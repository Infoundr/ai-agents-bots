        `Fundraising Experience:
        - For my first funding round, I structured a small pre-seed round from angel investors and grants targeted at my sector.
        - I focused on getting just enough capital to prove the concept before seeking larger institutional funding.
        - Key metrics that helped attract investors included customer traction, revenue growth rate, and market validation through partnerships.
        - An early mistake I made was underestimating our burn rate and raising less than needed, which forced seeking another round sooner than expected.
        - For valuation and equity splits, I used a SAFE agreement for flexibility and avoided giving up too much equity early on.
        - I brought in advisors to help with fundraising negotiations.`,
